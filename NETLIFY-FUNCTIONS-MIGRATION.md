# Netlify Functions Migration: Dwolla → Stripe + Plaid

**Migration Date**: 2025-01-22
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated all Netlify serverless functions from Dwolla ACH payment processing to Stripe ACH + Plaid instant bank verification. The migration simplifies the payment flow from a 3-step process to a unified signup-with-payment flow, while maintaining all security and reliability features.

---

## Migration Overview

### Old Flow (Dwolla - 3 Steps)
```
1. Frontend → create-dwolla-customer.js
   ├── Create Dwolla business customer
   ├── Add bank account as funding source
   └── Initiate micro-deposit verification (1-3 days)

2. Frontend → process-payment.js
   ├── Create payment record in database
   ├── Initiate ACH transfer via Dwolla
   └── Update payment with transfer ID

3. Dwolla → webhook-dwolla.js
   ├── Receive transfer_completed event
   ├── Update payment status
   └── Call create-company.js to create account
```

### New Flow (Stripe + Plaid - 1 Step)
```
1. Frontend → Plaid Link (instant bank verification)
   └── Get public_token + account_id

2. Frontend → signup-with-payment.js (ALL-IN-ONE)
   ├── Exchange Plaid public_token → processor_token
   ├── Create Stripe customer
   ├── Attach payment method using processor_token
   ├── Create payment record in database
   ├── Initiate ACH payment via Stripe
   ├── If payment succeeds immediately → create company
   └── Return success with payment status

3. Stripe → webhook-stripe.js (ASYNC)
   ├── Receive payment_intent.succeeded event
   ├── Update payment status
   └── Call create-company.js to create account (if not already created)
```

### 2. **webhook-stripe.js** (Replaces webhook-dwolla.js)
**Location**: `.netlify/functions/webhook-stripe.js`
**Size**: ~17KB
**Purpose**: Stripe webhook event processing

**Events Handled**:
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Payment cleared, trigger company creation
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Payment failed, update status
- `payment_intent.processing` - Payment processing
- `payment_intent.canceled` - Payment canceled
- `charge.succeeded` - Charge succeeded (tracking)
- `charge.failed` - Charge failed (tracking)
- `customer.updated` - Customer info changed
- `payment_method.attached` - New payment method added
- `payment_method.detached` - Payment method removed

**Security**:
- Stripe signature verification using `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()`
- Timing-safe HMAC validation
- Webhook event storage in `stripe_webhooks` table
- Automatic retry on processing failures

**API Endpoint**: `/.netlify/functions/webhook-stripe`

**Stripe Configuration**:
```bash
# Configure webhook in Stripe Dashboard
Endpoint: https://tradesphere.com/.netlify/functions/webhook-stripe
Events: payment_intent.*, charge.*, customer.updated, payment_method.*
```

---

### 3. **create-company.js** (Updated)
**Location**: `.netlify/functions/create-company.js`
**Changes**: Updated to use Stripe field references

**Field Updates**:
```javascript
// OLD (Dwolla)
dwolla_customer_id: validatedData.dwollaCustomerId
accountHolderName: validatedData.accountHolderName

// NEW (Stripe)
stripe_customer_id: validatedData.stripeCustomerId
stripe_payment_method_id: validatedData.stripePaymentMethodId
ownerName: validatedData.ownerName
subscriptionTier: validatedData.subscriptionTier
```

**New Schema**:
```javascript
{
  paymentId: z.string().uuid(),
  companyEmail: z.string().email(),
  companyName: z.string().min(2).max(100),
  stripeCustomerId: z.string().startsWith('cus_'),
  stripePaymentMethodId: z.string().startsWith('pm_').optional(),
  ownerName: z.string().min(2).max(100),
  subscriptionTier: z.enum(['starter', 'growth', 'enterprise'])
}
```

**Database Operations**:
- Creates company with Stripe customer ID and payment method ID
- Sets subscription tier and payment method status
- Creates Supabase Auth user
- Links owner_id to company
- Creates user profile record
- Links payment to company

---

## Files Archived

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Instant Bank Verification**
- **Old**: Dwolla micro-deposits (1-3 business days)
- **New**: Plaid Link instant verification (< 60 seconds)

### 2. **Simplified Flow**
- **Old**: 3 separate API calls, 2 webhooks
- **New**: 1 API call, 1 webhook (for async processing)

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- **Old**: Wait 1-3 days for verification → wait 3-5 days for payment → create account
- **New**: Instant verification → initiate payment → account ready (or webhook creates later)

### 4. **Enhanced Security**
- Stripe's built-in webhook signature verification
- Timing-safe HMAC comparison
- Idempotency checks in create-company.js
- Comprehensive error rollback

### 5. **ACH Processing Time**
- Same 3-5 business day ACH clearing time
- But company account can be created immediately after payment initiation
- User can start onboarding while payment clears

---

## Payment Flow Comparison

### Dwolla (Old)
```
Day 0:   Create customer → Initiate micro-deposits
Day 1-3: Wait for micro-deposits
Day 3:   Verify micro-deposits → Add bank account
Day 3:   Initiate ACH transfer
Day 6-8: ACH clears → webhook → create company
```
**Total: 6-8 business days**

### Stripe + Plaid (New)
```
Minute 0: Plaid Link verification (instant)
Minute 1: Initiate ACH payment
Minute 1: Create company immediately (or via webhook)
Day 3-5:  ACH clears → payment_intent.succeeded webhook
```
**Total: User can start using app immediately, payment clears in 3-5 days**

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is straightforward:

### 1. Restore Dwolla Functions
```bash
# Restore archived files
mv .netlify/functions/create-dwolla-customer.js.old .netlify/functions/create-dwolla-customer.js
mv .netlify/functions/process-payment.js.old .netlify/functions/process-payment.js
mv .netlify/functions/webhook-dwolla.js.old .netlify/functions/webhook-dwolla.js

# Archive Stripe functions
mv .netlify/functions/signup-with-payment.js .netlify/functions/signup-with-payment.js.disabled
mv .netlify/functions/webhook-stripe.js .netlify/functions/webhook-stripe.js.disabled
```

### 2. Restore Environment Variables
```bash
# Re-add Dwolla variables in Netlify Dashboard
DWOLLA_APP_KEY=...
DWOLLA_APP_SECRET=...
DWOLLA_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
DWOLLA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
DWOLLA_MASTER_FUNDING_SOURCE_URL=...
```

### 3. Restore Dependencies
```bash
npm install dwolla-v2
npm uninstall stripe plaid
```

### 4. Redeploy
```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. ACH Processing Time
- Still takes 3-5 business days for funds to clear
- Payment can fail after initial success (insufficient funds, account closed)
- Must handle late failures via webhooks

### 2. Plaid Link Token Expiration
- Link tokens expire after 4 hours
- Public tokens expire after 30 minutes
- Must exchange public token immediately after Plaid Link completes

### 3. Stripe Payment Intent Confirmation
- ACH payments cannot be immediately confirmed
- `payment_intent.status` will be 'processing' initially
- Must rely on webhooks for final status

### 4. Idempotency
- Must handle duplicate webhook events (Stripe retries)
- Must handle duplicate company creation attempts
- Use `stripe_customer_id` for idempotency checks

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Email Notifications
- Welcome email with login credentials
- Payment processing confirmation
- Payment success notification
- Payment failure notification with retry instructions

### 2. Subscription Management
- Recurring billing setup
- Automatic monthly charges
- Failed payment retry logic
- Subscription cancellation handling

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- More granular error codes
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Admin dashboard for manual intervention

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Plaid Link React component
- Payment status polling
- Real-time webhook notifications (via WebSocket)
- Onboarding wizard integration

## Support

### Debugging
```bash
# Test locally with Netlify Dev
netlify dev

# Monitor Stripe webhooks
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/webhook-stripe

# Check function logs
netlify functions:log webhook-stripe
netlify functions:log signup-with-payment
netlify functions:log create-company
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Webhook signature verification fails
**Solution**: Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe Dashboard webhook secret

**Issue**: Payment intent creation fails
**Solution**: Verify Stripe ACH is enabled for your account

**Issue**: Plaid token exchange fails
**Solution**: Check public token hasn't expired (30 min limit)

**Issue**: Company creation fails
**Solution**: Check Supabase RLS policies allow service key access
